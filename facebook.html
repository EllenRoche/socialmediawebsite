         <ul><li>Group chats: As a Facebook user you can make a Facebook group chat or direct message people individually if you are friends on Facebook or not. This can be very useful for third level educators as it’s a quick, easy way to contact one student or a certain group of students. By messaging students in group chats you get a quicker and less formal response than if you email students. </li>
             <li>Events: As a Facebook user you can also create events. This is very useful for third level educators when organising any events or talks. Eg. When the TU Dublin Creative Digital Media department hosted the “Make” event they could have made a Facebook event with all the information like dates, time, talks, how to purchase tickets and speakers. Having all the event information in one place for students to refer back to instead of sending each student multiple emails. They also could of hade the pages of the speakers in the event so students could go look into them themselves.  </li>
             <li>Pages: A Facebook page would be a great idea for a third level educator to create for their course or module. Almost everyone has a Facebook and it would be very useful for displaying students work done in the course and promoting the course to future third level students showing them what to expect and what they will alos be able to achieve during this course. It would also be good for students to see other students work for inspiration and to know the work standard they are expected to complete. </li>

This can be very useful for third level students as it’s a quick, easy way to contact one student or a certain group of students. By messaging other students in group chats you get a quicker and less formal response than if you email students. This can be great for organising group projects or presentations or even if your just confused and need a hand.  </li>
             <li>Events: As a Facebook user you can also create events. This is very useful for second level students when organising any events or talks. Eg. If you have organised a speaker for a module or a society you are in you can make a Facebook event with all the information like who, what, where and when. This can also be used to promote your society or talk.  Another use is an event page can be made for any of your society's charity events eg. fundraisers to spread the information. </li>
             <li>Pages: A Facebook page would be a great idea for a third level educator to create for their students of a certain course or module. It would be very useful for students to displaying their work done in the course and promoting the course to future third level students at the same time. Showing them what to expect and what they will also be able to achieve during this course. It would also be good for students to see other students work for inspiration and to know the work standard they are expected to complete. This can also bring students together with their peers that have the same interests as them,</li>
