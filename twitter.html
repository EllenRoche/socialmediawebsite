             <p>Educational use of Twitter for both students and teachers</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Twitter can be a very useful social media tool for both third level students and educators. As it is a microblogging site tweets/posts have to be short and to the point. This can be useful if a teacher creates a profile/page and chooses a #hashtag to do with the course or module the students can tweet snippets of their progress on projects and assignments. This would be very useful for times like this when we aren't seeing our lecturers on a weekly basis, they can still see your progress from your posts to make sure everyone is on the right track. In turn any student in the course can go to that hashtag and see others work and know where they should be on their assignments without having to text around and ask people individually. We used twitter for this with one of our lecturers during “Intro to digital media” and it was a very useful way to communicate.</li>
