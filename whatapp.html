             <p>Educational use of WhatsApp for both students and teachers</p>
         <ul>
             <li>WhatsApp can be a very useful social media tool for both third level students and educators, especially during times like this when students and educators can’t communicate in person.  

             The main use for WhatsApp would be to message multiple students in a group chat or individually.  The app also allows people to call, video call or send voice nots to others. This makes it super quick and easy for both students and educators to communicate. 

             During my first year of college I have used WhatsApp to create group chats for every group project and assignment we have been given. There was also a group chat made at the start of the year with each tutorial group and a bigger one with every student in the course these have both come in handy multiple times during the year. Eg. I sent a survey to be answered by students for a module into the CDM year one group chat it is convenient, and I got a quick response. </li>
