         <ul>
             <li>YouTube can be a very useful social media tool for both third level students and educators, especially during times like this when students and educators can’t attend their regular weekly lectures. 
             Lecturers can record lectures at home and upload them to YouTube. Students can then watch the lecture as many times and whenever they want. They can also reference and refer to lectures posted when doing any assigned work. Students can ask questions and talk in the comments. Lecturers can read and reply to comments. Students can record presentations at home to upload for the lecturer to see. They can also upload and video related projects. 
             Students can also use YouTube for research purposes for any subject.</li>
