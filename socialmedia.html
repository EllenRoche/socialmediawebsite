        <p>Many people see social media as apps on their phone or tablet, but it started with computers. The first social media site was called ‘Six Degrees’. It was created in 1997. It allowed users to upload and create a profile and make friends with other users. In 1999, the first blogging sites became popular, creating the social media sensation that is so popular today. I the last few year the popularity of social media apps has skyrocketed. Some people have made a living with a full-time social media career. It also allows businesses both large and small to freely market themselves or pay to be featured in videos and posts by these social media influencers. Majority of businesses can now be found on social media from your nail technician and local Chinese takeout to bigger fast fashion brands like misguided or pretty little thing. Social Media is also a place many artists show their work or talents. Every tattooist, photographer and signer have an Instagram with their work it acts as their online portfolio. It is a great space to share and appreciate others art and promote yourself to future employers.  </p>
